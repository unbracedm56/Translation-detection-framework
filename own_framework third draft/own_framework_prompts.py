Return YES if at least one supported error exists, else NO.

ACCURACY_PROMPT = f"""
You are an MT accuracy evaluator.

Task: judge whether MT has ACCURACY errors versus source and reference.

Definition: Accuracy errors occur when the MT fails to faithfully convey the meaning of the source.
This includes: added content, omitted content, wrong meaning, untranslated words.

Rules:
- Focus only on meaning transfer.
- Ignore fluency and style.
- Low probability if meaning is preserved.
- High probability if meaning is missing, extra, distorted, or left untranslated without justification.
- Justify using concrete words or phrases.

Task: judge whether MT has FLUENCY errors in the target language.

Definition: Fluency errors occur when the MT violates well-formedness of the TARGET language.
This includes: grammar mistakes, spelling errors, wrong punctuation, register mismatch,
awkward syntax, word-order issues, morphological errors, encoding artifacts.

Rules:
- Focus only on linguistic well-formedness.

translated incorrectly, inconsistently, or in a way that is inappropriate for the domain context.

Rules:
- Focus only on term usage.
- Ignore general grammar and style.
- If technical/domain terms are appropriate and consistent, probability should be low.
- Justify with exact terms.

STYLE_PROMPT = f"""
You are an MT style evaluator.

Task: judge whether MT has STYLE errors.

Definition: Style errors occur when the MT is grammatically correct and semantically accurate,
but the phrasing is awkward, unnatural, overly literal, or deviates from the expected register/voice.

Rules:
- Focus on phrasing, tone, and stylistic fit.
- Do not judge meaning or grammar unless they directly affect style.
- Justify with specific phrases.

- Ignore omission and mistranslation.
