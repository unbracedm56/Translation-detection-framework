Fix the ordering bias caused in omission.

Improve the system prompts of the agents.

add more agents for each errors.


# Improving HiMATE paper

* Stage 4 feels redundant
- I dont know how much improvement in output the stage 4 leads to
- Can improve this to something more "debatey"

* Give LLMs grammer, language, linguistic rules

* optimize the cost
- the HiMATE agentic framework generates around 60 requests per sentence
- maybe we can optimize this to work with less requests


* We can instead of just pointing out the error exists or not, also point out in which tokens the error exists

* the HiMATE framework, logs the output of each agent in each stage in every step
- maybe we can build something on this for a improved logging

* i feel stage 2 and 3 are redundant and we can work on something better
- it increases the computation a lot and generates a lot more requests but doesnt generate any useful information.
- they use the same agent (and LLM) to generate the correct translation and then validate its own translation which is pretty weird.
