Framework Idea

This idea is what would humans do.... How we break down a problem in our minds and solve it. Using statistics concepts.


Stage 1:
- Error evaluation using agents for each category (this is the super category as specified in MQM not our category)
- These agents will be given proper definition, some examples and access to a database containing linguistic and grammer rules that can be accessed if necessary.
- Output:
    * probability:
    * confidence:
    * reason:



Stage 2:
- Error evaluation using agents for each sub category (this is similar to our existing categories)
- Only the sub categories of the category that spiked and an error will be activated
- This stage is used to mimic cross validation on a more precise level.
- Output:
    * re evaluated probability:
    * thoughts: (what are you thinking based on stage 1)
    * reason: (why are you thinking that....)
    * re evaluated confidence: 



Stage 3:
- Acts as an evaluator, it only verify/ audits/ checks based on earlier stages it. It doesnt behave like a usual LLM like in the previous cases.
- Using the evaluations given from stage 1 and 2 go through the sentence and search for this errors and comment on whether they exists.
- Calculate and generate a consistency score to check whether the stage 1 and stage 2 align with each other or not.
- Find whether any error category was missed or not (either from stage 1 or 2).
- Output:
    * consistency score:
    * errors exists?:
    * missing errors?:
    * thoughts/reason:



Stage 4:
- this is the final stage, where the results of all other stages are combined together.
- We can use a mathematical, evidence based scoring for the final output.


[Opitional] Stage 5:
- Find where the error is.
- Also tell what should have been.


The responses of the agents are logged or documented every step of the way (just like the himate paper).
